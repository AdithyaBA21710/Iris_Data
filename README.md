# Iris_Data
Training a model to tell which species a flower belongs to based on its measurements.

The Iris dataset contains information about flowers — specifically, iris flowers of three different species: Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica.
Each flower is described by 4 features: Sepal length, width and petal length, width.

The model uses a decision tree classifier to classify the flowers based on their measurement.

The dataset is part of Scikit-Learn's vast dataset repository.
